# EV3 Robotics
## Spring 2020 Advanced Robotics
This repository contains code written in MicroPython that solves various tasks.
- Line Following: Robot attempts to move on an indicated line and stay on its track.
- Line Perpendicular: Robot moves forward until it detects a black line and repositions itself perpendicular to the line.
- Odometry: As its name implies, try to use data from motion sensors to estimate change in position over time.
- Sensor Tests: Just checking whether the ultrasonic, touch, infrared, and other sensors behave and return reasonably accurate values.
- Wall Following: Robot attempts to stay the same distance from a wall throughout its path.
